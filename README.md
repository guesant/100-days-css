This is an exercise in the following technologies:

* [Pug](https://pugjs.org)

And the following abilities:

* To not give up and not smash one's computer
* To investigate, explain and enforce industry standards as well as I can.
* To find and bookmark some very useful CSS sites
* To hopefully write some reusable CSS snippets


## TODO

* Find a way to lint pug.
